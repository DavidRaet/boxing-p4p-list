## Notes
**CSS Grid Mastery** Initially struggled with the CSS Grid responsive layout, but learned to use `minmax()` and `auto-fit` for flexible card arrangements and responsive layouts across all device sizes.
**React Component Architecture** Started everything with one component, then learned to create a sector for features concerning different components and how props enabled reusability, maintainable components.
**Advanced CSS Animations** Implementing hover effects and gradient shifts required understanding of CSS transformations; therefore, experimenting with the timing of professional functions. 
**Git Workflow Integration** Learning proper version control practices, including .gitignore configuration and line ending warnings on Windows systems. 
**Data Flow Understanding** Understanding how arrays, map functions, and props all worked in tandem to create a dynamic grid of cards containing fighter data.

These challenges ultimately led to a better comprehension of modern React workflow, Git integration, and CSS Responsiveness.
